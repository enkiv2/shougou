Rules: 
Given a board of arbitrary size, divided into squares, 
and black and white pieces, two players must take turns 
placing pieces onto the board. Pieces must be placed 
diagonal to other pieces (unless in the center or on the 
edge of the board), and may not be placed horizontally or 
vertically next to pieces of the same color unless they 
are on the edge of the board. The point of the game is to 
make the longest diagonal line of your own color while 
cutting off the other player.

Note:
The spaces are numbered starting with 0 as the first space, 
then 1, 2, etc., up to the number of spaces minus one. Also, 
the x and y coordinates are reversed.


Enjoy!
